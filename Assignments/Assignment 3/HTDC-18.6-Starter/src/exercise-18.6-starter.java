  Exercise 18.6

  Complete the class hierarchy for overlapping shapes from
  section 15.3: IComposite, Square, Circle, and SuperImp with all the methods:
  area, distTo0, in, bb. Add the following methods to the class hierarchy:

  1. same, which determines whether this shape is of equal size as some
  other, given IShape up to some given small number delta;

  2. closerTo, which determines whether this shape is closer to the origin
  than some other, given IShape;

  3. drawBoundary, which draws the bounding box around this shape.

  Develop examples and tests for as many methods as possible. Then
  introduce a common superclass for the concrete classes and try to
  lift as many fields and methods as possible into this
  superclass. Make sure that the revised classes function properly
  after this editing step.
