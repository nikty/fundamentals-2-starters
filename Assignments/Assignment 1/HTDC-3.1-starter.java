  Exercise 3.1
  
  Design a data representation for this problem:

  Develop a “real estate assistant” program. The “assistant” helps real
  estate agents locate available houses for clients.  The information
  about a house includes its kind, the number of rooms, its address, and
  the asking price. An address consists of a street number, a street
  name, and a city.

  Represent the following examples using your classes:

  1. Ranch, 7 rooms, $375,000, 23 Maple Street, Brookline;

  2. Colonial, 9 rooms, $450,000, 5 Joye Road, Newton; and

  3. Cape, 6 rooms, $235,000, 83 Winslow Road, Waltham.
