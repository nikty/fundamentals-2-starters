/*
  Suppose you are working on a research paper, and you have gathered a
  set of documents together for your bibliography: books and Wikipedia
  articles. Every document has an author, a title, and a bibliography
  of documents; additionally, books have publishers, and wiki articles
  have URLs.

  - Since you know that wiki articles are not necessarily authoritative
  sources[citation needed], you want to produce a bibliography
  containing just the authors and titles of the books you’ve found,
  either directly or transitively through the bibliographies of other
  documents. Format the entries as “Last name, First name. "Title".”

  - Since bibliographies must be alphabetized, sort the bibliography by
  the authors’ last names.

  - Documents may be referenced more than once, but should only appear
  in the bibliography once. Remove any duplicates (defined as the same
  author name and the same title)

  Design your data definitions to represent this information. Design a
  method to produce a properly formatted bibliography. Design whatever
  helper methods you need to solve the problem well.
